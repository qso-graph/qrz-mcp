# Changelog

All notable changes to `qrz-mcp` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.4] — 2026-09-28

### Added (CI hygiene)

- **MCP Registry sync** — `publish.yml` publishes to the [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io)
  after each PyPI publish, using GitHub OIDC for auth. Triggered on
  `v*` tag push; no manual steps. The Registry job waits until PyPI
  serves the version, and retries. Pattern documented in
  [qso-graph/.github/TEMPLATES.md](https://github.com/qso-graph/.github/blob/main/TEMPLATES.md).
- **Registry version badge** in README — PyPI and Registry versions
  are visible side-by-side so any drift between publishing surfaces
  is immediately apparent.
- **Release gates** — the tag must match `pyproject.toml`, and a
  `verify` job fails the release unless PyPI and the MCP Registry
  both serve the new version.

### Fixed

- The Official MCP Registry listed qrz-mcp at 0.2.0. This release brings it current.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- New tool `get_version_info` — returns `{service_name, service_version, spec_version}`
  for fleet identity attestation. Tracks [IONIS-AI/ionis-devel#49](https://github.com/IONIS-AI/ionis-devel/issues/49).
- `__spec_version__` pinned to `qrz-com-v1`.
- L2 unit tests QRZ-L2-044 through QRZ-L2-048.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — PR-gating CI (py3.10-3.13 matrix).

### Changed
- `__init__.py` modernized to fleet pattern (`Final` types).

## [0.3.2] — Previous release
- See git history for changes prior to the changelog being introduced.
